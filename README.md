# Chi-Sq-Benford-s-Law
This is a challenge project from Impractical Python Projects. This project is based upon the Illinois example in Ch16
As a new Pythonist this project for sure could be written w/ less code and more Pythonic but I needed lots of checks to make sure I was getting what I expected.
This is an adaptation of using the Chi-Sq statistic with Benford's Law to test distributions.
The Chi-square test statistic at 0.05 is 15.5. 
The original result Benford's Law Chi-square for Trump was 9.94 and Biden 13.63
The Chi-square results after the 'steal' are Trump 9.17 and Biden 11.67
The Chi-square test statistic should be considered an outer limit for the test in that values < the test stat means conformance to the expected distribution
While all of the stats from the project are within the 'pass' range results close to the statistic get troublesome. Interestingly, the Biden results are in that 
category for both, especially the un-fixed principal result.
