# Chi-Sq-Benford-s-Law
This is a challenge project from Impractical Python Projects. This project is based upon the Illinois example in Ch16
As a new Pythonist this project for sure could be written w/ less code and more Pythonic but I needed lots of checks to make sure I was getting what I expected.
This is an adaptation of using the Chi-Sq statistic with Benford's Law to test distributions.
The Chi-square test statistic at 0.05 is 15.5. 
The original result Benford's Law Chi-square for Trump was 9.94 and Biden 13.63
The Chi-square results after the 'steal' are Trump 9.17 and Biden 11.67
